### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been developing software and managing systems since before Github was born...

Here is a brief history: 

- Learned about computer programming in high school using Radio Shack TRS-80 and Apple IIe computers.
- Dove into source code of medical instruments to interface them with analog data acquisition and processing systems while a graduate student.
- Wrote software in Solaris to help oceanographers with data collection and analysis at sea.
- Wrote software to help scientists conduct research in micro-gravity.
- Wrote software to help astronauts conduct research on the SpaceLab and Space Station.
- Managed small scale clustered computers supporting medical imaging research.
- Build and managed national scale supercomputers.

âš¡ Fun fact: HPC Systems are not always what you think they are.
